  NORMALISE - Normalises image values to 0-1, or to desired mean and variance
 
  Usage:
             n = normalise(im)
 
  Offsets and rescales image so that the minimum value is 0
  and the maximum value is 1.  Result is returned in n.  If the image is
  colour the image is converted to HSV and the value/intensity component
  is normalised to 0-1 before being converted back to RGB.
 
 
              n = normalise(im, reqmean, reqvar)
 
  Arguments:  im      - A grey-level input image.
              reqmean - The required mean value of the image.
              reqvar  - The required variance of the image.
 
  Offsets and rescales image so that it has mean reqmean and variance
  reqvar.  Colour images cannot be normalised in this manner.
